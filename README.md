A comprehensive training presentation and hands-on lab exercises for using Claude Code in professional software development workflows.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

This course teaches professional developers how to:
- Create complete projects from scratch using Claude Code
- Navigate and understand complex codebases with AI assistance
- Implement the "branch-first" workflow for safe experimentation
- Generate comprehensive tests and documentation
- Refactor legacy code and modernize applications
- Use advanced Claude Code features like Plan Mode and custom commands

## üìö Getting Started with the Labs

### Prerequisites
- Claude Code installed and configured
- API key set: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"`
- Development environment for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Java

### Lab Structure
The `lab_handout.md` contains six progressive labs:

0. **Project Creation from Scratch** - Build a lyrics display app (recreates the `lyrics-trainer` origin story)
1. **Claude Code Basics** - Interface and project exploration
2. **Code Exploration** - Understanding complex codebases
3. **Test Generation** - Automated testing with AI
4. **Documentation Creation** - Professional documentation workflows
5. **Legacy Code Refactoring** - Modernizing Grails/Groovy applications
6. **Advanced Workflows** - Plan Mode, CLAUDE.md, and custom commands

### Teaching Notes
The `exercises.md` file contains detailed instructor guidance with specific prompts and a progressive story arc using the `flask-api` project as the primary demonstration vehicle.

## üèóÔ∏è Course Philosophy

- **Branch-First Workflow**: Emphasizes safe experimentation through Git branching
- **Practical Learning**: Real-world projects across multiple languages and frameworks
