# Claude Code Training Presentation Development

## Project Guidelines

This is a comprehensive Slidev presentation for Claude Code training, targeting professional developers and enterprise teams.

## Build Commands
- `pnpm dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm export` - Export to PDF

## Content Standards
- Focus on practical, enterprise-ready examples
- Use Java/Spring Boot as primary technology examples
- Include real-world use cases from Anthropic teams
- Maintain professional tone suitable for corporate training
- Keep slides concise and readable (avoid text overflow)

## Slide Design Principles
- **Avoid "Bullet-riddled corpse" anti-pattern** - Never create slides dense with bullet points
- **Many slides with few lines** - Prefer multiple focused slides over cramped multi-column layouts
- **One concept per slide** - Each slide should cover a single, clear idea
- **Minimize cognitive load** - Audience should grasp content at a glance
- **Progressive disclosure** - Break complex topics into logical slide sequences
- **White space is valuable** - Don't feel compelled to fill every slide completely

## Current Architecture
- Built with Slidev framework using Seriph theme
- Main content in slides.md with 110+ slides
- Comprehensive coverage from basics to advanced features
- Integration of latest Claude Code features (Plan Mode, Remote MCP, SDKs)
- Refactored to eliminate "bullet-riddled corpse" anti-pattern

## Recent Updates
- **Major refactoring** - Split dense slides to follow "many slides with few lines" principle
- **Eliminated bullet-riddled corpse** - Converted 12+ problematic slides into focused, digestible content
- **Improved layouts** - Fixed column layouts and centering issues for better readability
- Added Plan Mode functionality (Shift+Tab+Tab activation)
- Enhanced MCP section with remote server capabilities
- Added Claude Code SDKs for programmatic integration
- Updated with latest Anthropic best practices

## Refactoring Completed
- Course Overview → 3 focused slides (What You'll Learn, Course Structure, Why This Course Works)
- Understanding the Interface → 4 slides (Command Mode, Auto-Accept, Plan Mode, Key Features)
- Plan Mode → 2 slides (How to Activate, Perfect For)
- File Editing & Refactoring → 3 slides (Core Capabilities, Java Modernization, Spring Updates)
- Model Context Protocol → 3 slides (What is MCP, GitHub Server, Osquery Server)
- Claude Code SDKs → 2 slides (Available SDKs, Key Capabilities)
- Future Developments → 3 slides (Emerging Capabilities, Technical Evolution, Workflow Integration)
- Real-World Success Stories → 2 slides (Dev/Data Science, Security/Marketing)
- Good Practices → 2 slides (Development Best Practices, Session Management)
- Available MCP Servers → 2 slides (Development Tools, Enterprise Tools)
- Key Takeaways → 3 slides (Transform Process, Technical Excellence, Strategic Integration)
